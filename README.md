# üí´ About Me:
Hello! My name is Mehmet. As a student of Information Security Technology, I am dedicated to constantly expanding my knowledge and nurturing my passion for this field. Technology and security are not merely academic interests for me; they are personal passions and subjects of curiosity.

Throughout my university education, I've worked with various programming languages. I've developed projects using languages like Python, Java, C++, allowing me to refine my skills in algorithmic thinking.

My interest in web development continues to grow. I've learned to create interactive and user-friendly web interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I've gained the ability to develop modern and responsive designs using frameworks like Bootstrap.

In the field of information security, I particularly focus on network security, encryption, and security vulnerabilities. By conducting research in these areas, I strive to grasp fundamental principles and stay updated on current techniques. Exploring the concept of ethical hacking, I aim to deepen my perspective on information security.

I'm dedicated to continual self-improvement, leveraging various online resources, books, and practical experiences. Actively participating in different events allows me to keep up with industry advancements and learn from seasoned professionals.

In the future, I aspire to specialize in information security and contribute to the safety of the digital world. I firmly believe that by continuously enhancing my knowledge and practical experiences, I can produce more effective solutions for future projects and security challenges.

I find excitement in learning new things every day in software and security domains. I am happy to continue my efforts to expand my knowledge and acquire new skills in these fields.<br>
